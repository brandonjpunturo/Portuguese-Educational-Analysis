# Portuguese Education Analysis

One of the most important aspects of education is improving assessment scores
and final grades. It is a particularly tricky task, as students differ along so many characteristics.
The particular datasets that I decided to analyze for my final project tried to approach
achievement for Portuguese students at a secondary education level. There were two datasets I
looked at. The first corresponded to students in a Portuguese class and the other corresponded to
those in a math class. A lot of my questions revolved around the G3 (Final Grade) variable
present in both, as it is usually considered the most important variable in education assessment. I
was also curious if I could cluster students because perhaps it was possible that these clusters
learn differently in the classroom. Finally, I aimed to see if I could predict the ?famsup? (Family
Education Support) variable using a classification algorithm. If an individual does not have
family support for his/her education, it is likely they are not putting an optimal amount of effort
into school.

Questions I asked:
1.How does the distribution of finals grades for the math class compare to the final grades of the
Portuguese class?
2.What variables are highly positively/negatively correlated for final grades in the math class and
Portuguese class?
3.Can I use a Linear Regression model to predict G3 scores for both classes?
4.Do students who drink heavily in the math class on the weekend get worse final grades than
those who do not drink at all on the weekend?
5.Can students in the math class be clustered into groups?
6.Can I create a classification model to predict family support for students in the Portuguese
class?
